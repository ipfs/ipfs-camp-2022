| 10:00 | Intro | <a href="https://github.com/autonome"><img src="https://github.com/autonome.png?size=200" alt="autonome" width="100" /></a><br>[Dietrich Ayala (@autonome)](https://github.com/autonome) | Welcome, overview | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:10 | IPFS in Web Protocol Handlers with Agregore Browser | <a href="https://github.com/rangermauve"><img src="https://github.com/rangermauve.png?size=200" alt="rangermauve" width="100" /></a><br>[Mauve Signweaver (@rangermauve)](https://github.com/rangermauve) | We'll be showcasing how IPFS can have deep integration with web protocol handlers, and will be answering the question "What does it mean to POST to `ipfs://`?" | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:30 | Making Brave an InterPlanetary browser | <a href="https://github.com/onyb"><img src="https://github.com/onyb.png?size=200" alt="onyb" width="100" /></a><br>[Anirudha Bose (@onyb)](https://github.com/onyb) | Brave is building a privacy-first internet stack with a private browser, search, web3 wallet, and more. In this session, we'll look at the state of IPFS and Filecoin integrations in Brave, and learn about some of the lesser known features in Brave that makes it an interplanetary browser. | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:50 | Chrome pre-defined Custom Handlers for IPFS | <a href="https://github.com/javifernandez"><img src="https://github.com/javifernandez.png?size=200" alt="javifernandez" width="100" /></a><br>[Javier Ferndandez (@javifernandez)](https://github.com/javifernandez) | High-level overview of the refactoring Implemented in Chrome's source code to define a dedicated component for the Custom Handlers logic. Thanks to this refactoring, we have improved the support for Chrome embedders to implement their own pre-defined Custom Handlers for the schemes they consider strategic. Patching Chrome to add a pre-defined Custom Handler to manage IPFS schemes is now trivial, reducing considerably the efforts of embedders to deal with rebases in order to sync with Chrome upstream. | Video<br>Slides |

| 11:20 | Decentralized Web Archiving: Create your own web archive using a browser, IPFS and Webrecorder tools | <a href="https://github.com/ikreymer"><img src="https://github.com/ikreymer.png?size=200" alt="ikreymer" width="100" /></a><br>[Ilya Kreymer (@ikreymer)](https://github.com/ikreymer) | This will be a hands-on workshop, where participants will be able to use various Webrecorder tools to create their own decentralized web archives, using their browser and our interactive browser extension (ArchiveWeb.page) or command-line crawling tools (Browsertrix Crawler) for larger-scale archiving. We will start with an introduction to Webrecorder tools and web archiving and allow participants to create their own archives. Participants will then be able to place their archives on IPFS and share with others. | Video<br>Slides |
| 11:40 | IPFS Goes Mobile | <a href="https://github.com/fabricedesre"><img src="https://github.com/fabricedesre.png?size=200" alt="fabricedesre" width="100" /></a><br>[Fabrice Desr√© (@fabricedesre)](https://github.com/fabricedesre) | Capyloon is an experimental web based mobile OS. It aims at giving users more control over their digital life, with decentralized technologies as a cornerstone of the solution. We'll talk about the early steps, current status and what to expect next. | Video<br>Slides |
| 12:00 | Gateways of the Future (and Now Too) | <a href="https://github.com/lidel"><img src="https://github.com/lidel.png?size=200" alt="lidel" width="100" /></a><br>[Lidel (@lidel)](https://github.com/lidel) | HTTP gateways are a key onramp for IPFS usage not only by browsers, but tools, APIs and more. Learn about the state of the IPFS HTTP gateway implementation in Kubo today, and new features and changes coming soon. | Video<br>Slides |
