| 13:30 | Hands On with IPFS - Installing, using the CLI and implementing kubo in a boilerplate app | Lindsay Walker | Lindsay Walker will lead a hands-on workshop to help you get up and running with IPFS | Video<br>Slides |
| 14:30 | Fleek XYZ + IPFS Storage plugin Workshop | Max Boytsov | 1. We’ll write a skeleton with dummy modules for IPFS Storage Plugin<br>2. We’ll start to fulfil the plugin, starting from its metadata and ending all the different methods being written with an SDK<br>3. Once the plugin file is finished, we’ll build the plugin library for it and import it into the fleek-xyz GraphQL module.<br>4. We’ll go to the Fleek.xyz UI to show:<br>    1. How the newly created plugin is displayed in the list of storage plugins <br>    2. How we’re initializing that plugin. | Video<br>Slides |
| 15:00 | Leveraging Crypto Storage Primitives for building Huddle01’s DRTC | Akshit Gupta | While utilizing IPFS/Filecoin for storing recordings of huddle01 meetings, we came across the need for a solution to be able to upload, share and monetize videos in a piracy-resistant way and how huddle01 is building this easy-to-use video Infrastructure to revolutionize video storage and decentralized tools for private video hosting using huddle01’s powerful SDK. | Video<br>Slides |

| 16:35 | NIMI.eth - Web3 Social powered by IPFS | Dave Montali | Nimi is a social aggregator, which allows users to effortlessly host on their ENS domains - powered by IPFS in the background. From hackathon to thousands of users we grew with IPFS and took a journey through the ecosystem. Today Nimi users have IPNS keys set on their ENS domains, allowing them to update their Nimi profiles without transaction fees.  | Video<br>Slides |
| 16:45 | Endless Jewellery: How IPFS can store memories in gold | Konrad Urban | Jewelry, but with a letter salad: NFC IOT NFT IPFS. How does it all fit together?
