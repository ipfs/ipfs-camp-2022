| Start Time | Topic | Speaker | Description | Recording |

| 09:50 | Track Introduction | Cory Schwartz | Welcome! | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:00 | Build the web we want | Sara Freenan (Consensys) | Recently, we deprecated our public gateway and it came to light that creators<br>had been using our public gateway url, along with the CID, in their NFT<br>metadata, instead of using the CID. <br><br>I would like to take this opportunity to remind people that IPFS is about building<br>a decentralised web that is not beholden to one company or organisation. CIDs are<br>content identifiers, not resource locators. The beauty of the protocol is that the<br>content can be found on the network using the CID via the cooperation of the node<br>providers, and the built in redundancy of the protocol. <br><br>The decentralised and resilient web we want will rely on people embedding these new<br>patterns into whatever they create and build on top of the protocol and we at Infura<br>want to help in whatever way we can.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:35 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 10:40 | Protecting IPFS gateways at scale | Matt Ober (Pinata) | IPFS gateways are an important portal into the IPFS network, but running publicly<br>accessible IPFS gateways comes with great risk and responsibility. In this talk Matt<br>will discuss common challenges that IPFS gateway operators will encounter and how<br>Pinata has solved for them.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 11:15 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 11:20 | Secure your IPFS website | Thibault Meunier (Cloudflare) | For wallets, decentralized exchanges, DeFi insurer, or DAO management, most IPFS<br>applications are relying on HTTP. This setup allows applications to be accessible by<br>current web users, with minimal modifications. It also enables developers to leverage<br>common web engineering practice. However, these HTTP endpoints have to be secured, and<br>trust provided by the decentralized-network has to be carried to end-users. HTTPS is<br>not enough. This talk will present the setup of a browser based IPFS app.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 11:55 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 12:00 | Bridging the worlds - the care and feeding of IPFS Gateways | Mario Camou (Protocol Labs) | For several years, Protocol Labs has operated one of the busiest public IPFS gateways in the world, ipfs.io. During that time we have learned a few things about their care and feeding. In this presentation, Mario will share some of the practices that we have implemented to ensure that our gateways are healthy and useful.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 12:40 | Fleek Network - Decentralized Content and Application Delivery Network | Mahmoud Shehata (fleek) |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 13:00 | Lunch |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 14:00 | Introducing Saturn, web3 CDN | Ansgar Grunseid (saturn) | Saturn is a Web3 CDN in Filecoin's retrieval market built with IPFS-addressable data.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 14:35 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 14:40 | Pinset orchestration with IPFS Cluster | Héctor Sanjuán (Protocol Labs) | IPFS Cluster makes distributing a pinset across an scalable set of Kubo peers easy.<br>In this talk, we will explore the basic features, setup and monitoring for home and<br>production deployments.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 15:15 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 15:20 | What Kubernetes Operators Do That Regular Deployments Do Not | Oleg Silkin (Red Hat) | By the end of this talk  users will know how Kubernetes Operators can improve their<br>experience with deploying large-scale applications in their clusters. Attendees will<br>also learn how IPFS Cluster leverages the Operator SDK in order to easily perform<br>horizontal scaling of Web3 storage. <br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 15:55 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 16:00 | Elastic IPFS -- The scales are off the charts! | Alan Shaw (Protocol Labs) | What even is Elastic IPFS and how much stretch does it have? THIS is the story of the<br>brand new multi tenant IPFS implementation that runs in the cloud, separates read and<br>write pipelines to really, truly achieve web scale beyond anything this world has even<br>seen before.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
| 16:35 | break |  |  | Video<br>Slides |
| 16:40 | IPFS Service Panel |  | Panel discussion of gateway operators, pinning services, and others who operate IPFS<br>services.<br> | Video<br>Slides |
